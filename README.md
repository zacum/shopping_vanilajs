For storing user data we also used LocalStorage.

## Flow of the website 
- When You land on hompage you should login first , for that click on login if already login in then just enter your ID and password. And if you are new then just create you credentials. 
- After that you see all variety of products on the landing page, you can add fruits to the cart. 
- After adding items to the cart you will click on the cart to go into the cart page. 
- On cart page you can see all the items that you have added. You can delete the item from cart page if you want. 
- Then you will select address and entre the coupon as "Flat20" then you will get 20% discount on your total amount.

### End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project we were tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with very limited knowledge of javascript & css. This entire journey of has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence.

### Limitations:
All pages are not responsive yet , those pages are might not be properly visible on small screen devices.
(Recomended Resolution: 1366 x 768 )
